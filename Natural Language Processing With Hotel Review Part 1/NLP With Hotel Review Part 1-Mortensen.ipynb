    "Review score distributions depend on customer satisfaction with the hotel. When the customer experience is not well controlled (different customers receive different levels of service) reviews are likely to have broad distributions. When customer experience is well controlled, the reviews are more likely to have narrow distributions. The centroid of these distributions is correlated with the overall quality of the experience and whether it meets, exceeds, or is below expectations. In poorly controlled situation it is somewhat likely to have a bimodal distribution in the reviews as a result of customers being either happy or unhappy overall.  \n",
